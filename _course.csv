Name,Overview
Manufacturing Data Science,"MDS course supports students learning how to apply artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data science (DS) techniques to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the manufacturing systems. MDS integrates the knowledge domains of the information, engineering, and management. Encourage students to solve the real problem systematically using the design of analytics, from descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive to automating, for successfully enhancing decision quality."
Statistical Learning and Deep Learning,"Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer sciences and machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the regularized regression, classification, graphic models, and recently deep learning. The goal of this course is to introduce a set of tools for data analytics. We will cover the principles and applications of these models/tools. These tools will not be viewed as black boxes. Instead, students will be exposed to the details, not just the use, of these tools. The main reason is that no single approach will perform well in all possible applications. Without understanding how a tool work, it is impossible to select the best tool. This course is appropriate for master's students and advanced undergraduates who wish to use statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning to analyze their data.?"
Web Application Programming,"This course covers basic concepts and applications such as web design, back-end database, and web page conversion into mobile APP, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, SQL, NoSQL, and Cordova. Throughout the course, by using a certain field as the theme and using project management methods to create projects with the goal of solving real problems, the purpose of learning is further achieved and students' learning effectiveness is improved. Through group discussions and project reports, students can share their problem-solving processes and reflections, thereby improving the learning effect."
