      "In this course, we will cover several research methods widely employed in IS research (e.g., survey, experiment, design science, etc). In addition, being a multidisciplinary field of study, IS research (especially behavioral IS research) draws upon various existing theories developed in other disciplines to explain or predict a phenomenon of interest to IS field (e.g., individuals’ or organizations’ behavior in a socio-technical context). Hence, we will also discuss theories that are commonly adopted by IS research. Besides the lectures by the instructor, the course will also be conducted in the paper-presentation-and-critic format. Through reading and presenting assigned papers, students are expected to gain an understanding on contemporary IS research and to establish appropriate perception about what a research is. Complementarily, through paper discussions and critics, students are expected to improve their critical and logical thinking and to develop their competence in identifying and justifying interesting and valuable research questions, both of which are essential research capabilities that doctoral students need to learn. 課程目標 The objective of this course is to give students an overview of information systems and management research (or IS research for short). Information systems/technologies adopted by and deployed in firms generally have implications for improving firm performance and competitive advantages as well as enabling business innovation and transformation. However, how to realize these benefits relies on firm’s effective development and management of such information systems/technologies. Hence, IS research is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on the design, development, implementation, use, and impact of information technologies/systems by individuals, groups, organizations, or society. As a result, IS research encompasses a wide range of topics and involves different types of research methods, and it plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges and opportunities that arise in the digital age. 課程要求 Paper Presentations For each week that is designated to students’ presentations, two or three articles (depending on the size of the class) will be assigned. For each article to be presented, one student will be assigned as a presenter to go over the article. The presenter needs to prepare a 40-minute presentation on the assigned article. All other students in the class are expected to finish the reading and participate in discussions. Besides presenting the material reported in the assigned article, the presenter is required to highlight the following in the presentation: • What is the research gap(s) addressed in the study? What are the major contributions (both academic and practical) of the study? Justify. • What are the major research questions/objectives? Have the research questions been addressed adequately? • What are the major strengths? • What are the shortcomings or the areas of concern (challenges to the contribution or to validity of the research)? What can we do to address these shortcomings or areas of concern if we were to conduct the same research? • What are the possible extensions of the study? • What is the evolution of research relevant to the topic investigated in this study? To answer this question, you may need to conduct additional literature search, review, and summary. After each paper presentation, the instructor will facilitate in-class discussions. Thus, besides understanding the details of the research study reported in the article, all students in the class should also focus on the aforementioned questions. Theory Review Assignment and Presentation One theory review assignment will be given in this course. Students are asked to review two theories that have used in IS research. The selection of theories to review is of students’ choice. However, to avoid duplicate selection (i.e., multiple students select the same theory to review), the TA of the course will coordinate with all students in advance. When reviewing a theory, students are responsible to detail what each theory is about and to illustrate the focal theory with some IS articles that use this theory as their theoretical foundation. Each student also needs to prepare a 30-40-minutes presentation (depending on the size of the class) in class to share his/her review of theories. In addition, students are required to turn in a written assignment reoort. Term Research Project You are required to undertake individually a term research project related to IS research. Your term project needs to clearly address a research question and provide preliminary, potentially promising research results to the topic under investigation. Before you decide your project direction and scope, you are encouraged to discuss your thought(s) and plan with the instructor. In your project proposal and during the project proposal presentation, you are required to 1) articulate the motivation and importance of your research project, 2) clearly define your research objective, 3) provide a preliminary literature review, and 4) select and justify an appropriate research method. You are expected to prepare a 10-minute project proposal presentation and a 5-page written project proposal. At the end of semester, 30-40 minutes are allocated to each project presentation. Again, you are expected to report the research motivation and objective, literature review, detailed research model (or design), data collection, and important analysis results. In addition, you have to show the significance of your research project by discussing your contributions to the topic under investigation and other areas related to your research project. Participation Students are strongly encouraged to participate in class discussions. Levels of participation will be evaluated based on each student's contribution to class discussions, not just on class attendance.\n",

      "Data mining techniques can be classified into the following categories: classification and prediction, clustering, association rules, and sequential patterns. Data mining techniques have also been extended to deal with unstructured documents (referred to as text mining). This course will be devoted to allow students understand the concepts of data mining and text mining, explore some interesting data/text mining applications (e.g., event detection and tracking, patent mining, biomedical literature-based discovery, pharmacovigilance data mining, etc.), and identify new data/text mining research issues and applications. 課程目標 To prepare students with an understanding of existing data/text mining techniques and interesting data/text mining applications and to facilitate students to identify new data/text mining research issues and applications. 課程要求 Each student is expected to be in charge of five to six paper presentations. For each research article, the presenting student needs to summarize and present the materials (i.e., research background and motivation, literature review, detailed algorithmic/technical design, evaluation design and procedure, and evaluation results) reported in the paper. All other students in the class are also expected to finish the reading and participate in discussions. Toward the end of the semester, each student is required to propose a research idea related to the data/text mining domain . The research idea proposal needs to clearly address a research question. A review of related literature and an analysis of research gap to justify the research motivation of the proposed research idea are also needed.\n",

It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer sciences and machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the regularized regression, classification, graphic models, and recently deep learning. The goal of this course is to introduce a set of tools for data analytics. We will cover the principles and applications of these models/tools. These tools will not be viewed as black boxes. Instead, students will be exposed to the details, not just the use, of these tools. The main reason is that no single approach will perform well in all possible applications. Without understanding how a tool work, it is impossible to select the best tool.

      " 資訊科技與商業模式創新\n",
      "商業模式(Business Model)，簡單的說，就是一個企業如何創造、傳遞及獲取價值的手段與方法。我們可以透過解構其中關鍵的要素來幫助企業思考自身的定位與競爭策略，進而創造出收益。「商業模式」一詞雖然在60年代就已出現，但卻是在90年代末期電子商務興起後才吸引更多的學者投入研究，而隨後網路的蓬勃發展與資訊科技不斷的進展，更帶來許多的商業模式創新與非凡的新創。本課程希望藉由介紹與探討不同的資訊科技新創個案與其商業模式，包含過去失敗的案例，培養學生創新能力與創業精神(entrepreneurship)，以應對新科技帶來的挑戰和機遇。 在探討個案時，我們會著重在資訊科技帶來的商業模式創新，例如通過新的價值主張、定價模式、服務模式或渠道帶來的創新。個案包括共享經濟的AirBnB、Uber Eats、WeWork。我們還將以三個創新路徑：挑戰現狀、尋找未被滿足的需求、以及洞察趨勢、掌握機會來討論不同的創新個案。最後，大多數商業模式都可以模仿，所以商業模式創新只能帶來短期優勢。因此，創新者在思考商業模式創新時，也必須思考如何從這種短期優勢中構築競爭壁壘，以抵禦後進者的威脅。 註：要修本課程學生請注意，本學期課程在9/14、9/21的課程因故必須調整至9/13、10/4晚上 6:30-9:10補課 (但課程會錄影供無法出席學生觀看)。 A business model is essentially the means and methods by which a company creates, delivers, and captures value. By deconstructing its key elements, we can help businesses think about their positioning and competitive strategies, thereby generating revenue. Although the term “business model” appeared in the 1960s, it wasn't until the late 1990s, with the rise of electronic commerce, that more scholars became interested in researching it. The subsequent flourishing of the Internet and continuous advancements in information technology brought about numerous innovations in business models and extraordinary startups. This course aims to introduce and explore various information technology startup cases and their business models, including past failed cases, to cultivate students' innovation capabilities and entrepreneurship spirit in order to address the challenges and opportunities brought by new technologies. When discussing these cases, we will emphasize business model innovations brought about by information technology, such as innovations through new value propositions, pricing models, service models, or channels. Cases include sharing economy platforms like Airbnb, Uber Eats, and WeWork. When going through the cases, we can see that innovations arise in the following three pathways: challenging the status quo, identifying unmet needs, and discerning trends and seizing opportunities to discuss different innovative cases. The three pathways, therefore, shed some light on opportunities for innovation. It is also worth noting that most business models can be imitated, leading to only short-term advantages. Therefore, when contemplating business model innovation, innovators must also consider how to construct competitive barriers based on these short-term advantages to defend against threats from newcomers. 課程目標 個案分析能力、創意思考、競爭策略與創新創業精神 如何運用資訊科技驅動商業模式創新 Case analysis skills, creative thinking, competitive strategies, and entrepreneurialship. How to leverage information technology to drive business model innovation. 課程要求 具備基本的資訊科技知識 積極的學習態度 對於新科技的好奇 Possessing fundamental knowledge of information technology. Maintaining a proactive learning attitude. Displaying curiosity towards new technologies.\n",

      "大綱、講義等詳見課程網站： https://scmu.github.io/plfp/ ========= 本課程為「程式語言(Programming Languages)」系列課程之一，著眼點並不是教特定程式語言，而是以函數語言(functional language)為媒介，討論設計程式解決問題的思考方式、設計程式使用的數學與邏輯基礎、以及程式語言與形式符號在其中扮演的角色。其核心概念包括： - 程式語言是一種形式語言，作為思考的工具。我們用程式語言表達概念，也用程式語言中的形式規則檢驗程式的正確性。 - 函數程設(functional programming)是一種相當簡化的程式設計模型。因為簡單，有更多易於掌握的性質，可作為討論程式語言的基礎。 - 有一整套程式設計理論奠基於歸納法(induction)之上。資料結構可用歸納法定義，其上的程式可用歸納寫成，關於該程式的性質也可用歸納法證明。與之相對的是餘歸納(coinduction). - 上述兩種方法都不足以定義出所有程式 -- 為此我們將需要允許遞迴 (general recursion) 的模型. 然而，表達力變強大也意味著我們將失去一些好性質。 - 程式設計與定理證明是密切相關、相輔相成的活動。 - 函數語言這樣的簡單模型允許我們做等式推導，可作為一種程式設計方法 -- 將程式「算」出來。 - 好的型別系統常有「只要型別對，程式就會對」的特性。 - 型別系統與邏輯有密切關係：邏輯陳述相當於型別，具有該型別的程式則是該邏輯陳述的證明。 - 型別系統能幫助我們確立程式的正確性，甚至輔助我們寫程式。 - 更強大的型別系統相當於更具表達力的邏輯。同樣地，邏輯變強大的同時，我們也犧牲掉一些好掌握的性質。 課程目標 以函數語言為起點，瞭解程式語言在語法、語意、與實務面向的課題。 課程要求 修過程式設計相關課程，有基礎程式設計能力。\n",

It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer sciences and machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the regularized regression, classification, graphic models, and recently deep learning. The goal of this course is to introduce a set of tools for data analytics. We will cover the principles and applications of these models/tools. These tools will not be viewed as black boxes. Instead, students will be exposed to the details, not just the use, of these tools. The main reason is that no single approach will perform well in all possible applications. Without understanding how a tool work, it is impossible to select the best tool. This course is appropriate for master's students and advanced undergraduates who wish to use statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning to analyze their data. 課程目標 Omitted. 課程要求 本課程對程式能力有一些要求，如果你不會寫程式，請不要修這門課。助教不會教你寫程式、不會幫你寫程式、不會幫你安裝Jupyter Lab或其他工具。具體的程式能力的要求是： ‧ 本課程會使用Python + Jupyter Lab 做為主要工具，修課學生須具備基本的Python Programming知識，例如Jupyter Lab安裝與操作、Import 與使用Module、使用Pandas與Numpy操作與分析資料等。 ‧ 自己延伸學習在課堂與作業中會使用的其他Module。 *Grade Distribution* The course grades will be determined by the following percentages: Homework (Python-based) (5-6 Assignments) 60% Attendance, participation & quizzes 10% Final Project (Presentation) 30% Total 100% *Computational Tools* Students are required to use Python 3 (Version >=3.7) (with scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, pytorch, etc.) to solve homework assignments. *Homework* There are at least five graded assignments. Unless otherwise stated, students must organize their code and results using Jupyter Lab (with Python 3; Version >=3.8) and submit their *.IPYNB file together with the exported HTML file to NTUCOOL.

      " 資訊科技與商業模式創新\n",
      "商業模式(Business Model)，簡單的說，就是一個企業如何創造、傳遞及獲取價值的手段與方法。我們可以透過解構其中關鍵的要素來幫助企業思考自身的定位與競爭策略，進而創造出收益。「商業模式」一詞雖然在60年代就已出現，但卻是在90年代末期電子商務興起後才吸引更多的學者投入研究，而隨後網路的蓬勃發展與資訊科技不斷的進展，更帶來許多的商業模式創新與非凡的新創。本課程希望藉由介紹與探討不同的資訊科技新創個案與其商業模式，包含過去失敗的案例，培養學生創新能力與創業精神(entrepreneurship)，以應對新科技帶來的挑戰和機遇。 在探討個案時，我們會著重在資訊科技帶來的商業模式創新，例如通過新的價值主張、定價模式、服務模式或渠道帶來的創新。個案包括共享經濟的AirBnB、Uber Eats、WeWork。我們還將以三個創新路徑：挑戰現狀、尋找未被滿足的需求、以及洞察趨勢、掌握機會來討論不同的創新個案。最後，大多數商業模式都可以模仿，所以商業模式創新只能帶來短期優勢。因此，創新者在思考商業模式創新時，也必須思考如何從這種短期優勢中構築競爭壁壘，以抵禦後進者的威脅。 註：要修本課程學生請注意，本學期課程在9/14、9/21的課程因故必須調整至9/13、10/4晚上 6:30-9:10補課 (但課程會錄影供無法出席學生觀看)。 A business model is essentially the means and methods by which a company creates, delivers, and captures value. By deconstructing its key elements, we can help businesses think about their positioning and competitive strategies, thereby generating revenue. Although the term “business model” appeared in the 1960s, it wasn't until the late 1990s, with the rise of electronic commerce, that more scholars became interested in researching it. The subsequent flourishing of the Internet and continuous advancements in information technology brought about numerous innovations in business models and extraordinary startups. This course aims to introduce and explore various information technology startup cases and their business models, including past failed cases, to cultivate students' innovation capabilities and entrepreneurship spirit in order to address the challenges and opportunities brought by new technologies. When discussing these cases, we will emphasize business model innovations brought about by information technology, such as innovations through new value propositions, pricing models, service models, or channels. Cases include sharing economy platforms like Airbnb, Uber Eats, and WeWork. When going through the cases, we can see that innovations arise in the following three pathways: challenging the status quo, identifying unmet needs, and discerning trends and seizing opportunities to discuss different innovative cases. The three pathways, therefore, shed some light on opportunities for innovation. It is also worth noting that most business models can be imitated, leading to only short-term advantages. Therefore, when contemplating business model innovation, innovators must also consider how to construct competitive barriers based on these short-term advantages to defend against threats from newcomers. 課程目標 個案分析能力、創意思考、競爭策略與創新創業精神 如何運用資訊科技驅動商業模式創新 Case analysis skills, creative thinking, competitive strategies, and entrepreneurialship. How to leverage information technology to drive business model innovation. 課程要求 具備基本的資訊科技知識 積極的學習態度 對於新科技的好奇 Possessing fundamental knowledge of information technology.

      "大綱、講義等詳見課程網站： https://scmu.github.io/plfp/ ========= 本課程為「程式語言(Programming Languages)」系列課程之一，著眼點並不是教特定程式語言，而是以函數語言(functional language)為媒介，討論設計程式解決問題的思考方式、設計程式使用的數學與邏輯基礎、以及程式語言與形式符號在其中扮演的角色。其核心概念包括： - 程式語言是一種形式語言，作為思考的工具。我們用程式語言表達概念，也用程式語言中的形式規則檢驗程式的正確性。 - 函數程設(functional programming)是一種相當簡化的程式設計模型。因為簡單，有更多易於掌握的性質，可作為討論程式語言的基礎。 - 有一整套程式設計理論奠基於歸納法(induction)之上。資料結構可用歸納法定義，其上的程式可用歸納寫成，關於該程式的性質也可用歸納法證明。與之相對的是餘歸納(coinduction). - 上述兩種方法都不足以定義出所有程式 -- 為此我們將需要允許遞迴 (general recursion) 的模型. 然而，表達力變強大也意味著我們將失去一些好性質。 - 程式設計與定理證明是密切相關、相輔相成的活動。 - 函數語言這樣的簡單模型允許我們做等式推導，可作為一種程式設計方法 -- 將程式「算」出來。 - 好的型別系統常有「只要型別對，程式就會對」的特性。 - 型別系統與邏輯有密切關係：邏輯陳述相當於型別，具有該型別的程式則是該邏輯陳述的證明。 - 型別系統能幫助我們確立程式的正確性，甚至輔助我們寫程式。 - 更強大的型別系統相當於更具表達力的邏輯。同樣地，邏輯變強大的同時，我們也犧牲掉一些好掌握的性質。 課程目標 以函數語言為起點，瞭解程式語言在語法、語意、與實務面向的課題。 課程要求 修過程式設計相關課程，有基礎程式設計能力。\n",
