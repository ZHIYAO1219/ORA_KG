Name,Overview
Manufacturing Data Science,"MDS course supports students learning how to apply artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data science (DS) techniques to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the manufacturing systems. MDS integrates the knowledge domains of the information, engineering, and management. Encourage students to solve the real problem systematically using the design of analytics, from descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive to automating, for successfully enhancing decision quality."
Operations Research Applications and Implementation ,"This course will provide students to learn the methodologies of operations research and its applications to the real problem. The models include deterministic models (such as linear programming, multi-criteria decision analysis, data envelopment analysis, etc.) and stochastic models (such as Bayesian decision analysis, stochastic programming, Markov decision process, etc.). The course integrates the knowledge domains of the management and engineering, applied in capacity planning, facility layout, supply chain, manufacturing scheduling, performance evaluation, vendor selection and order allocation, Bin-packing, financial investment, etc. We develop the implementation capability of the information system in practice. Finally we should know how to solve the real problem systematically using optimization or statistical methods.  "
Web Application Programming,"This course covers basic concepts and applications such as web design, back-end database, and web page conversion into mobile APP, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, SQL, NoSQL, and Cordova. Throughout the course, by using a certain field as the theme and using project management methods to create projects with the goal of solving real problems, the purpose of learning is further achieved and students' learning effectiveness is improved. Through group discussions and project reports, students can share their problem-solving processes and reflections, thereby improving the learning effect."
